Moore’s law:
- Predicted that transistor density would double every 2 years.
- Not a physical law, just an observation.
- Smaller transistors switch faster.
- Exponential increase in density would lead to exponential increase in speed.

The speedup that we get from Moore's Law can't continue because transistors consume power and power is becoming a critical issue - Power Wall
- As you increase number of transistors, power used also increases (smaller transistors use less power but transistor density scaling is much faster).
- High power leads to high temperature, but air cooling (fans) has limitation to remove the heat.

Dennard Scaling
- Voltage should scale with transistor size that keeps power consumption, and temperature, low.
- But Voltage can’t go too low, it limited by threshold voltage. 
- There are also noise problems limit voltage scaling.
- We should consider leakage power, it's limits the voltage scaling.

Cannot increase frequency without limit.
- P = α * CFV^2, frequency still goes up but with slow rate.
